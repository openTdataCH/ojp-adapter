/**
 * A common problem of converting pairs of similar objects one to another.

 * Goals: - domain/entity classes (for e.g. Hafas raw model) to DTOs, which are then sent to frontend as JSON objects in this VERY DIRECTION only. - DTO classes shouldnâ€™t know about domain/entity
 * classes and the other way round. - No coupling between the two kinds of objects
