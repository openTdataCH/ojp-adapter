 * The accessibility of a site is described using an ACCESSIBILITY ASSESSMENT: this allows to express the accessibility either in terms of suitability for specific USER NEEDs â€“ for example wheelchair,
 * hearing impaired, vision impaired, lift-averse, etc. - using a SUITABILITY element, or in terms of ACCESSIBILITY LIMITATIONs, i.e. description of the limitations of a site to support a specific
 * need, for example Wheelchair, Step free, Escalator free, Lift free or both.
