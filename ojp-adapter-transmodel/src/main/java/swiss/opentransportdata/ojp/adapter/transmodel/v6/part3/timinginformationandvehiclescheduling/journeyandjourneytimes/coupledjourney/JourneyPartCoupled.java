/**
 * Two JOURNEY PARTs of different VEHICLE JOURNEYs served simultaneously by a train set up by coupling their single vehicles.
 * <p>
 * Transmodel considers different concepts (Coupled Journey Model):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a COUPLED JOURNEY: A complete journey operated by a coupled train, composed of two or more VEHICLE JOURNEYs remaining coupled together all along a JOURNEY PATTERN. A COUPLED JOURNEY may be viewed as a single VEHICLE JOURNEY.</li>
 *   <li>JOURNEY PARTs: A part of a VEHICLE JOURNEY created according to a specific functional purpose, for instance in situations when vehicle coupling or separating occurs.</li>
 *   <li>A JOURNEY PART COUPLE: two JOURNEY PARTs of different VEHICLE JOURNEYs served simultaneously by a train set up by coupling their single vehicles.</li>
 * </ul>
