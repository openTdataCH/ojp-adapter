/**
 * Handpicked strongly referring model classes from downloadable **conceptual** Transmodel ("TransmodelV6.eap" Sparx Repository).
 * <p>
 * TRM classes are modeled as simplified Interfaces in this package and become a specific implementation model within ojp-adapter. Conceptual Data Model for Public Transportation abstracting OJP,
 * NeTex, Siri, IFOPT,..
 * <p>
 * The package path(s) are related to the conceptual TRM model organization given by the downloadable "TransmodelV6.eap" (UML repository for Sparx Enterprise Architect), though there is no propagated
 * implementation model yet by Transmodel design.
